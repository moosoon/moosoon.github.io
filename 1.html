  <p style="margin-top:50px;">You don't bring home roses
  You just bring home stress
  You never say I look good
  When I'm looking my best (No, no)
  And if we're staying up all night
  It's 'cause you're moaning
  And not the good kind
  Want you to be happy
  But not at my expense
  The more I listen and I listen
  The more I'm thinking</p>
  <p><strong>You don't need a girlfriend<br>
  You just need a therapist</strong><br>
  You got too much drama
  I'm not qualified to fix
  I would hold your body
  But you want somebody
  That will hold your shit together
  You don't need a girlfriend
  <u>Truth is</u></p>
