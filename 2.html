    If you don’t wanna see me

Did a full one eighty, crazy
Thinking bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me, maybe
But look at where I ended up

I’m all good already
So moved on it’s scary
I’m not where you left me at all

So if you don’t wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you want to believe that anything could stop me
</p>
<p>
Don’t show up
Don’t come out
Don’t start caring
About me now
Walk away
You know how
Don’t start caring
About me now
</p>
<p>
Aren’t you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word goodbye
Though it took some time to survive you
I’m better on the other side

I’m all good already
So moved on it’s scary
I’m not where you left me at all

So if you don’t wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you want to believe that anything could stop me
</p>
<p>
Don’t show up
Don’t come out
Don’t start caring
About me now
Walk away
You know how
Don’t start caring
About me now

Don’t start now
Don’t start now
Don’t start now
I’m not where you left me at all
</p>
<p>
So if you don’t wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you want to believe that anything could stop me

Don’t show up
Don’t come out
Don’t start caring
About me now
Walk away
You know how
Don’t start caring
About me now</p>
